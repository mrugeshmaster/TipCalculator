## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

* Initially created Swift app instead of Storyboard and created a mess. Solved by creating a Storyboard app.
* Unable to set Initial Screen after adding Navigator. Solved by googling it and making changes in Attributes inspector.
* Tried adding Settings screen to set default Tip percentage, but unable to reflect it on Main screen.
* Read view controller lifecycle and successfully added default tip functionality using Settings Screen.
